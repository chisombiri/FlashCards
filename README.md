# FlashCards
Digital note cards used for studying and improving memory through practiced information retrieval.

Two-sided, with the prompt on one side and the information about the prompt on the other.

Flashcards have be very effective to me while studying. They even challenge me to think about which information to have on one side and the related description on the other. Repititively looking at them helps me figure out what information I can remember easily and what needs additional effort. I decided to move away from my sticky notes and build a digital version, with my coding knowledge; for any one to make use of! ðŸŒŽ
